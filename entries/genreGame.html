            The genre of my game will be being a goalkeeper to save bouncing balls.</p>
            You have to move the Goalie with your arrow keys up, down, left or right. And in order to win you have to beat 5 levels like lets say the shooter gets 5 shots on you as a goalie you move your arrow keys and need to save 4/5 shots in order to go to the next level. There are 5 levels.
