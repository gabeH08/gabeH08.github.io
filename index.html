 <h1 class=> Welcome to my Website </h1>
 <h3 class=>(About Me)</h3>

   <p> My name is Gabriel Hilarion, I am a student at Arlington Career Center high school in Arlington, Virginia. I'm currently a sophomore, and my interests are dancing, biking, coding, listening to music, and hanging out with friends. I'm half Bolivian and half Argentinian. In my free time at home I go and bike around my neighbourhood and/or play video games. I play for a travel soccer team in a ECNL league called Lee Mount Vernon. After school I go to the gym when I have no assingments to turn in but if I do have assingments I go to the library and complete homework or study for upcoming tests. I work in the weekends as a Arlington Soccer Association Referee, I only work in seasons, season usually starts around in spring and fall. I'm currently working on getting a second job by asking my counselor for help.</p>
